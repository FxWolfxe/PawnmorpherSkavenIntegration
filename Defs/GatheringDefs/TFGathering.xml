        <letterText>After dragging the (un)fortunate {target_nameDef} to the Table of Thirteen, {organizer_nameDef} begins the dreaded incantations, seeking the malevolent Horned Rat's Favour in this endeavor. 
            A blessing to be brought upon {target_nameDef} to begin their change and bring them into the fold as one of the Horned One's Children. The ritual is excrutiating, as evidenced by the prisoner's screams of anguish, but the Horned Rat's pleasure is one so great,
            you and your skaven can feel His putrid Favour falling upon {target_nameDef} and so the ritual has begun.</letterText>
